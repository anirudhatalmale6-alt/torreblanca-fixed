TORRE BLANCA - CHANGES LOG
===========================
Date: 2026-01-15

ISSUES FIXED:
-------------

1. PISO-3 (Desktop) - app.js
   - PROBLEM: Bug in onLeave() function was closing all panels when mouse left
     a hotspot area. This caused galleries and detail panels to close unexpectedly.
   - FIX: Removed the erroneous panel reset code from onLeave() function
     (lines 156-160). Panels should only close via Back button clicks,
     not on mouse leave.
   - Also cleaned up indentation in bind() function for panel initialization.

2. MOBILE VERSION - Missing Assets
   - PROBLEM: piso-4/assets/apto-03/ folder was empty
   - PROBLEM: piso-5/assets/apto-04/ folder was empty
   - PROBLEM: piso-5/assets/ contained wrong folder (apto-02)
   - FIX: Copied correct assets from desktop version:
     * torre-blanca/piso-4/assets/apto-03/* -> torre-blanca-m/piso-4/assets/apto-03/
     * torre-blanca/piso-5/assets/apto-04/* -> torre-blanca-m/piso-5/assets/apto-04/
   - FIX: Removed incorrect apto-02 folder from torre-blanca-m/piso-5/assets/

3. CLEANUP
   - Removed all .bak.* backup files from both torre-blanca and torre-blanca-m

KNOWN ISSUES (pre-existing, not introduced by this fix):
--------------------------------------------------------
- apto-03-mask-lavanderia-y-cuarto-muchacha.jpg.filepart is incomplete/corrupted
  in piso-4. The app handles this gracefully (doesn't show mask if file missing).

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
- torre-blanca/piso-3/app.js (bug fix)
- torre-blanca-m/piso-4/assets/apto-03/* (assets added)
- torre-blanca-m/piso-5/assets/apto-04/* (assets added)
- torre-blanca-m/piso-5/assets/apto-02/ (folder removed)
- Various *.bak.* files removed

TESTING NOTES:
--------------
- All floors (2-5) should now behave identically
- Gallery panels should stay open until Back button is clicked
- Detail panels should display photos and text correctly
- Mobile version now has correct assets for piso-4 and piso-5
